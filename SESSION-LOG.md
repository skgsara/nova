# SESSION-LOG.md — Nova

Newest entry first. Append-only: correct by adding an entry, never by
rewriting an old one. Every entry ends with the exact next step.
This file is tracked in git (Sara, session 1: "we don't need to hide
anything as our develop history").

## 2026-08-12 — Session 1 addendum: first commit
- Scaffold committed as `20a9a64` on `main`; SESSION-LOG.md un-ignored
  and tracked per Sara's call. Regular commit standards from here on.
- Resolved: commit author is "skgsara <skgsara@riseup.net>", set
  repo-local; both commits amended (now `99408ab`, `e49834d`).

**Next step (unchanged):** M0 — harness signal generator + minimal FM
demod; decode `test chart.m4a` (via WAV) headlessly into an image.

## 2026-08-12 — Session 1: briefing, decisions, scaffold
Agent: Kimi Code CLI. Lane: n/a (no lanes in this project).

**Done:**
- Read SOP.md (v2 method), extracted and read WMO-386 Vol I Part III §5
  (pp. 287–291, the normative analogue-fax signal spec) and all of
  ISO 9876:2015 (9 content pages; §4.2 is the software-applicable core).
- Surveyed prior art: JWX source (PLL demod, Goertzel tones, hardcoded
  576/120, no per-line resync), HamFax (via GitHub mirror README;
  sourceforge.net 403s this host), fldigi (SF page), ACFax 0.981011
  source (fs/4 quadrature + normalized discriminator + arcsin LUT;
  raw-stream-retention architecture), KiwiSDR FaxDecoder.cpp (GPLv3,
  D'Epagnier/weatherfax_pi; contains ACFax's FIR tables verbatim —
  confirmed single GPL lineage ACFax→HamFax→yahfax→weatherfax_pi→
  KiwiSDR).
- Inventoried Sara's recording library (~600 MB, 7+ stations, m4a/AAC
  44.1–48k stereo + WAV 12/16/44.1k). Kept outside the repo.
- Decisions (Sara's): RX only; ISO 9876 §4.2 as acceptance contract,
  WMO-386 for the signal; NO 240 lpm (not ISO-required); GPLv3 with
  reuse from the surveyed lineage; tiered platform support; C++17 +
  FLTK + RtAudio; repo in subfolder `nova/`; project name "Nova";
  m4a via runtime `ffmpeg`, WAV native.
- Scaffolded: LICENSE (GPLv3), NOTICE (lineage + standards citations),
  README, .gitignore, AGENTS.md, START-HERE.md, ROADMAP.md, docs/00-02.

**Contradictions found:**
- Isobar README (v1.0.2, live) still cites "ITU-R F.460" — the SOP
  records that citation as a hallucination purged from five files.
  Nova cites WMO-386 / ISO 9876 only. Follow-up on Isobar side is
  Sara's call.
- KiwiSDR repo has no root LICENSE file (404); FaxDecoder.cpp carries
  a per-file GPLv3 header (D'Epagnier). Reuse is per-file-licensed.

**Next step:** git init + first commit ONLY when Sara asks. Then M0:
build the harness signal generator + minimal FM demod, decode
`test chart.m4a` (converted to WAV) headlessly into an image.
